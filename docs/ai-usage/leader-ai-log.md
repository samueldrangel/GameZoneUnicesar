## 📑 Module Responsibilities Summary
- Project structure setup, Git Flow configuration, and branch protections (main, develop).
- Implementation of the Sale domain class and calculation of sales total.
- Implementation of SaleRepository for flat-file persistence (data/sales.txt).
- Implementation of SaleService managing cross-module business logic (stock verification, item inventory updates).
- Implementation of the ui layer (ConsoleUI) and entry point (Main.java).
- Pull Request reviews and code integration across all three modules.

## 📌 Detailed AI Interaction Records

### Session 1: Designing Inventory Update Rules in SaleService
- *Date:* 09/06/2026
- *Prompt / Query Asked to AI:*
  > "How should SaleService interact with ProductService to validate stock and update inventory automatically upon a sale transaction?"
- *Context & Problem:* SaleService needed to coordinate with ProductService to verify that a product has sufficient stock before allowing a sale, and subsequently deduct the sold quantity.
- *AI Response Summary:* Advised injecting ProductService into SaleService and performing a two-step operation: validating stock limits for all items first, and executing stock deduction only after ensuring all items pass validation.
- *Developer Action & Validation:* Implemented the dependency injection in SaleService.java, ensuring transactions fail gracefully without modifying inventory if stock is insufficient.

### Session 2: Structuring layered Dependency Injection in Main.java
- *Date:* 09/06/2026
- *Prompt / Query Asked to AI:*
  > "What is the correct order to instantiate repositories, services, and the UI in Main.java following 4-tier architecture?"
- *Context & Problem:* Ensuring strict layered architecture compliance (UI -> Service -> Persistence -> Model) without circular dependencies or layer-skipping.
- *AI Response Summary:* Detailed the bottom-up initialization sequence: first repositories (ProductRepository, PersonRepository, SaleRepository), then services passing their respective repositories, and finally ConsoleUI receiving all services.
- *Developer Action & Validation:* Structured Main.java according to this sequence and verified that ConsoleUI communicates exclusively with service classes.

### Session 3: Resolving Git Flow Integration and Pull Request Merges
- *Date:* 09/06/2026
- *Prompt / Query Asked to AI:*
  > "How do I resolve merge conflicts in develop when integrating feature/product-module and feature/person-module?"
- *Context & Problem:* Merging feature branches from Developer 1 and Developer 2 created minor path conflict in documentation and repository configurations.
- *AI Response Summary:* Provided step-by-step Git commands to fetch the target branch, resolve conflicts locally, run Maven build verification (mvn clean compile), and complete the merge.
- *Developer Action & Validation:* Merged both PRs successfully into develop, ensured clean compilation, and deleted merged feature branches as specified in Git guidelines.

## 🛡️ Ethics & Compliance Declaration
1. *Self-Comprehension:* All architecture decisions, service orchestrations, and integration PRs were managed and validated manually in Apache NetBeans and GitHub.
2. *Academic Integrity:* AI was used exclusively as a reference tool for architectural layer alignment, cross-service validation logic, and Git Flow conflict resolution, fulfilling sections 16 & 18 of the project guidelines.
